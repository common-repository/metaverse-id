Display your identity from around the metaverse!

== Description ==

"Metaverse ID" for WordPress is based on the work of the currently retired swslr project. The plugin aims to allow its users to place widgets into the sidebars of their WordPress blogs that let them show of their profiles around the Metaverse.

Supported Metaverses
--------------------
* Champions Online
* EVE Online
* Everquest, Everquest II
* Free Realms
* Lord of the Rings Online
* Metaplace
* Progress Quest
* Second Life (Agni/Main Grid, Teen Second Life)
* Star Trek Online
* World of Warcraft (Europe, US)

Metaverse Configuration
--------------------
Some Metaverses (such as EVE) require some extra info in order for Metaverse ID to access the data. A menu for Metaverse ID will be added to the *Settings* menu if one of the supported Metaverses requires configuration.

If you try to update a Metaverse ID and you repeatedly get a message to the effect that the update failed, check to make sure that the Metaverse has been correctly configured!

== Installation ==

1. Ensure your server is using PHP5, this plugin does not support PHP4.
1. Upload the `metaverse-id` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Screenshots ==

1. The `Metaverse ID` plugin page before any profiles have been added.
2. Adding multiple profiles in one go.
3. Profiles haven't been cached yet! Better force an update to get the profiles cached.
4. Freshly cached profiles. Ticking the box in the `Update` column can be used to force an update of the profile cache. Shortcodes for each profile are displayed.
5. Individual widgets for each ID! Inactive widgets displayed, Second Life widget in screenshot has the [MV-ID WP Avatar](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/mv-id-wp-avatar/) plugin active.
6. How the widgets look in the default WP theme.
7. By ommitting the id parameter in the mv-id shortcode, the plugin will attempt to display all cached IDs.
8. With the h parameter set to a number between 1 and 6, the shortcode output will include the name of the metaverse wrapped in the appropriate HTML tag.

== Requirements ==

* PHP5 (I'm using features not present in PHP4, WordPress runs fine on PHP5, so upgrade already!)
* DOMDocument (required for Second Life, LOTRO, Champions Online)
* SimpleXML (required for WoW, Metaplace, EVE)
* JSON decode support (required for Free Realms)
